# --------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the development code

You will need to obtain the development code if you want to run the
latest, perhaps unreleased version or if you want to experiment with
it or improve it in some way.

The code can be cloned from its git repository:

    https://github.com/kablamo/VimDebug.git

To run it, you will also need:

    . A 5.FIXME Perl; CPAN access may be required.
    . A 7.FIXME Vim built with the +perl and +signs extensions.

To try out the development code with no interference whatsoever from
any other Vim module or setup, we have supplied a script that you can
use, like this for example:

    .../script/vim $file_to_debug

Note that if you make any changes to the development code, for those
code changes to apply you will have to relaunch that Vim instance.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing the development code

At some point, you may want to make your copy of the development code,
with your modifications, the VimDebug you regularly use, perhaps
replacing an already installed instance. To do this, you must first
package the VimDebug distribution with DistZilla (you may need to
learn about and install Dist::Zilla from CPAN):

    dzil test
    dzil build

That will update or create a VimDebug-x.xxx/ directory and a
VimDebug-x.xxx.tar.gz file, each containing an image the distribution
in its current state.

So you can now install the module either from that newly built
directory, or by expanding the .tar.gz archive somewhere and moving to
that directory, and then:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you don't possess sufficient privileges to install where your
current perl runs from, or simply to avoid writing there, CPAN's
local::lib module may prove useful.

Then, don't forget to then run the Vim component installer, for
example:

    vimdebug-install -d ~/.vim

See L<Vim::Debug::Manual> for more information.

Releasing to CPAN

Currently, only kablamo does this.

FIXME Eventually flesh this out, for documentation purposes.

Custom debugger support

If you just want to add support for your debugger, its easy.  Really.  Here's
how in just 3 steps:

STEP 1: Read the ARCHITECTURE document (its short and easy)
        perldoc Vim::Debug
        perldoc Vim::Debug::Perl

STEP 2: Create lib/Vim/Debug/DebuggerName.pm (not hard)

STEP 3: Look at DBGRgetDebuggerName() in vimDebug.vim.  If necessary, add code
        like:

           elseif l:fileExtension == ".java"
              let l:debugger = "Jdb"
              return l:debugger

        l:debugger should match the name of your Perl module in step 2.  



Another option is to write your own version of vdd in your language
(ruby/python/etc) and ensure it understands the network protocol used by
VimDebug.vim.  Also note that you will need to use something event based to do
this.  Think about how you will handle infinite loops.  This approach is
probably going to take you longer I'm thinking.
